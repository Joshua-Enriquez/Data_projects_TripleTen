# Manhattan Rental Market Project
This is the first project I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was an independent project designed to showcase what I have learned about Advanced Spreadsheets. This project is about analyzing Airbnb listings in Manhattan, NYC, to help a client's decide what type of rental property to invest in.
